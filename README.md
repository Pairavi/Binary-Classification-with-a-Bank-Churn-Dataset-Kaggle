# Binary-Classification-with-a-Bank-Churn-Dataset-Kaggle

The Bank Churn challenge provides us with a dataset containing various customer-related features, such as credit score, geography, gender, age, balance, and more. Our task is to build a machine learning model that can predict the probability of a customer churning based on these features. The performance of our model will be evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) metric.
